# Operationalizing Machine Learning

## 1. Overview

In this project, you will continue to work with the Bank Marketing dataset. You will use Azure to configure a cloud-based machine learning production model, deploy it, and consume it. You will also create, publish, and consume a pipeline. In the end, you will demonstrate all of your work by creating a README file and a screencast video.

Project main steps
In this project, you will following the below steps:

* Authentication
* Automated ML Experiment
* Deploy the best model
* Enable logging
* Swagger Documentation
* Consume model endpoints
* Create and publish a pipeline
* Documentation

## 2. Architectural Diagram
TODO: Provide an architectual diagram of the project and give an introduction of each step. An architectural diagram is an image that helps visualize the flow of operations from start to finish. In this case, it has to be related to the completed project, with its various stages that are critical to the overall flow. For example, one stage for managing models could be "using Automated ML to determine the best model".
