# Capstone Project - Credit Scoring Modeling 

## 1. Project Overview

## 2. Goals

## 3. Dataset

## 4. Preprocessing Step

As the focus of this capstone project is to show the skills learned so far in the nanodegree, I will not focus on many possible approaches for this problem.

## 4. Training

...

Moreover, I would like to try different AutoML tools instead of restricting the use of the Hyperdrive and Azure AutoML. Below, a short list of options available that I incorporate in this capstone:

* [FLAML - Fast and Lightweight AutoML from Microsoft](https://github.com/microsoft/FLAML)
* [H2O AutoML](http://docs.h2o.ai/h2o/latest-stable/h2o-docs/automl.html)
* [AutoSKLearn](https://automl.github.io/auto-sklearn/master/)

### 4.1 Standard Models

Here, I call standard models the easiest models I can deploy to check their performances and behaviors. Here my list of models that I am used to trying first:

* Decision Trees
* Random Forest
* Logistic Regression (standard, L1-regularized, and L2-regularized)
* K-Nearest Neighbors
* Gradient Boosting Trees
