# Azure Machine Learning Nanodegree 

## Brief description of the program

In this program, students enhance their skills by building and deploying sophisticated machine learning solutions using popular open-source tools and frameworks and gain practical experience running complex machine learning tasks using Azure. During the nanodegree, two end-to-end machine learning projects are developed. A capstone project is developed at the end of the course to challenge the skills gained by the student.

Some topics discussed in this nanodegree:

* Azure Machine Learning Studio
* Azure Machine Learning SDK using Python
* Construction of automated and resilient pipelines
* Automated ML (autoML), Hyperparameter tuning
* Pipeline Optimization
* Machine Learning Operations (MLOps)
* Serving Models through Azure using REST APIs


## Projects

### 1. Optimizing an ML Pipeline in Azure

In this project, an end-to-end project is developed using the Azure Machine Learning Studio and the Python programming language. The main goal here is to create two models, the first one is a L2-regularized logistic regression with hyperparameter tuning using the hyperdrive package. The other model is chosen using the AutoML tool available on Azure ML studio, and the best one is chosen. After using both approaches, the models are compared in the same test set. 

Technologies involved:
* Azure Machine Learning Studio
* HyperDrive
* AutoML
* Python/Azureml packages
* Azure Designer
* Azure Pipelines

### 2. Operationalizing Machine Learning

Continuing the evolution of the past project, here we continue to work with the Bank Marketing dataset. We must use Azure to configure a cloud-based machine learning production model, deploy it, and consume it. We also create, publish, and consume a pipeline. In the end, a screencast video is recorded to show how the project works.

Technologies involved:

* Azure Machine Learning Studio
* Azure RBAC
* Azure AutoML
* Azure Pipelines
* Swagger
* Apache Benchmark
