# Azure Machine Learning Nanodegree 

## Brief description of the program

In this program, students enhance their skills by building and deploying sophisticated machine learning solutions using popular open-source tools and frameworks and gain practical experience running complex machine learning tasks using Azure. During the nanodegree, three end-to-end machine learning projects are developed. A capstone project is developed at the end of the course to challenge the skills gained by the student.

Some topics discussed in this nanodegree:

* Azure Machine Learning Studio
* Azure Machine Learning SDK using Python
* Construction of automated and resilient pipelines
* Automated ML (autoML), Hyperparameter tuning
* Pipeline Optimization
* Machine Learning Operations (MLOps)
* Serving Models through REST APIs
