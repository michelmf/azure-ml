# Optimizing an ML Pipeline in Azure

## Overview

This project is the first in the Udacity Azure ML Nanodegree program. In this project, students must build and optimize an Azure ML pipeline using the Python SDK and the Scikit-learn package. After these steps, the model is compared to an Azure AutoML run. The picture depicted below shows the approach followed in this project.

## Summary
The dataset [Bank Marketing Data Set](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/bank+marketing) is related with direct marketing campaigns (phone calls) of a Portuguese banking institution. The classification goal is to predict if the client will subscribe a term deposit.

## Scikit-learn Pipeline
**Explain the pipeline architecture, including data, hyperparameter tuning, and classification algorithm.**

**What are the benefits of the parameter sampler you chose?**

**What are the benefits of the early stopping policy you chose?**

## AutoML
**In 1-2 sentences, describe the model and hyperparameters generated by AutoML.**

## Pipeline comparison
**Compare the two models and their performance. What are the differences in accuracy? In architecture? If there was a difference, why do you think there was one?**

## Future work
**What are some areas of improvement for future experiments? Why might these improvements help the model?**

## Proof of cluster clean up
**If you did not delete your compute cluster in the code, please complete this section. Otherwise, delete this section.**
